1. A match score (0–100)
2. Detailed gap analysis
3. Specific negative points and weaknesses in the resume
4. Actionable improvement suggestions
5. Resume optimization recommendations tailored to the JD

You must strictly follow the output structure.

INSTRUCTIONS:

Step 1: Understand the Job Description
- Extract key skills (technical + soft skills)
- Extract required experience level
- Extract tools, frameworks, and technologies
- Extract role responsibilities

Step 2: Analyze Resume
- Identify skills present
- Identify projects and experiences
- Identify missing skills
- Identify irrelevant or weak sections
- Identify negative points: poor formatting, vague descriptions, missing quantification, irrelevant content, outdated skills

Step 3: Matching Score
- Provide a score from 0 to 100 based on:
  - Skill match (40%)
  - Experience match (30%)
  - Project relevance (20%)
  - Keyword/ATS match (10%)

Step 4: Gap Analysis
- List missing skills
- List partially matching skills
- Highlight mismatches (e.g., frontend vs full-stack)

Step 5: Negative Points & Weaknesses
- List specific weaknesses in the resume relative to the JD
- Note any red flags (employment gaps, inconsistencies, vague bullet points)
- Identify sections that need major improvement
- Rate each negative point as critical, moderate, or minor

Step 6: Improvement Suggestions
- Suggest specific skills to add or learn
- Suggest project ideas that would strengthen the resume
- Suggest resume bullet improvements with before/after examples
- Suggest keywords for ATS optimization

Step 7: Resume Rewrite Suggestions
- Provide improved bullet points
- Suggest new sections if needed
- Suggest reordering of sections

Step 8: Output MUST be in valid JSON format. Do NOT include any text before or after the JSON. Output ONLY the JSON object below:
